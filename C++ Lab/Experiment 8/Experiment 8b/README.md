# Experiment 8b
## Aim of Experiment
#### Write a C++ program on Friend class
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment

Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2- Create a class named Exmp_A with the following class members.
'x' as a private data member

Step 3- Declare a friend class named Exmp_B 

Step 4 - Initialize x value using a constructor

Step 5 - Create a class named Exmp_B with the following class members.
'y' as a private data member and sum() as member function

Step 6 - Initialize y value using a constructor

Step 7 - Write the respective code to perform addition.

Step 8 - Create a main() method.

Step 9 - Create the object b of the above class Exmp_B respectively inside the main() method.

Step 10 - print the value of sum.

Step 11 - returnn 0 to exit form the program execution.
