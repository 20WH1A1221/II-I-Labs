# Experiment 3
## Aim of the Experiment
#### Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of each employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary)
###  Step by Step Procedure of the Experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h, conio.h, and windows.h for colors).
Step 2 - Create a class Employee with the following members.
emp_number, emp_name, basic, da, it, gross_salary, and net_salary as data memebrs
read_emp_details(), find_net_salary(), and display_emp_details() as member functions.
Step 3 - Implement all the member functions with their respective code.
Step 4 - Create a main() method.
Step 5 - Create an array of class object with a specific size and number_of_emp as integer.
Step 6 - Read number_of_emp.
Step 7 - Call the read_emp_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to number_of_emp.
Step 8 - Call the find_net_salary() method through the array of class object from 0 to number_of_emp.
Step 9 - Call the display_emp_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to number_of_emp.
Step 10 - returnn 0 to exit form the program execution.
